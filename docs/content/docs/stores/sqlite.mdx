title: SQLite Store
description: Lightweight SQLite store for development, testing, and single-node deployments.
---

The `store/sqlite` package implements Nexus's `store.Store` interface using the grove ORM with the SQLite driver. It requires no external database process, making it ideal for development, integration tests, and single-node deployments.

## Usage

```go
import (
    "github.com/xraph/grove"
    "github.com/xraph/grove/drivers/sqlitedriver"
    "github.com/xraph/nexus/store/sqlite"
)

db, err := grove.Open(sqlitedriver.Open("nexus.db"))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

s := sqlite.New(db)
if err := s.Migrate(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

gw := nexus.New(
    nexus.WithDatabase(s),
)
```

Pass `":memory:"` for a fully in-process, zero-persistence store useful in tests:

```go
db, err := grove.Open(sqlitedriver.Open(":memory:"))
```

## Internals

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Driver | grove ORM + sqlitedriver |
| Migrations | grove orchestrator with programmatic migrations |
| Transactions | SQLite-level transactions |
| Concurrency | Multiple readers, single writer (WAL mode) |

## When to use

- Development and local testing without external dependencies.
- Single-process or embedded deployments.
- CI pipelines where spinning up PostgreSQL is impractical.
